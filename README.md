# NN_Numpy

See tests at bottom of file for how to train and test my neural network. 

I have implemented a few performance functions, a few transfer functions, 
a feedforward or cascade forward (or customizable) network structure, 
regularization, random reinitializations of weights, 
stochastic batch or mini batch training, and an adaptive learning rate.

Make sure to use sigmoid on the output layer for only-positive outputs.
Use tanh for positive/negative outputs. It is not necessary to normalize the data, 
but centerring the outputs may be benefitial if using the tanh transfer function to the output layer.
